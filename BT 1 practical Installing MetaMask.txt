Installing MetaMask and understanding how to spend Ether (ETH) per transaction involves several steps. Here's a basic guide to help you get started:

**1. Install MetaMask:**
   - MetaMask is a popular Ethereum wallet and browser extension. To get started, you need to install it in your browser. Here are the general steps for Google Chrome:
     1. Open your Chrome browser.
     2. Go to the Chrome Web Store.
     3. Search for "MetaMask" in the search bar.
     4. Click on "Add to Chrome" next to the MetaMask extension.
     5. Follow the installation prompts and add the extension to your browser.

**2. Create a Wallet:**
   - After installing MetaMask, you need to create a wallet if you don't already have one. Here's how:
     1. Click on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser.
     2. Follow the setup process to create a new wallet. This will include setting up a strong password and writing down your recovery seed phrase. Store this phrase securely, as it's essential for wallet recovery.

**3. Fund Your Wallet:**
   - To spend Ether, you need to have some in your MetaMask wallet. You can:
     - Buy Ether from a cryptocurrency exchange and transfer it to your MetaMask wallet.
     - Receive Ether from others by sharing your Ethereum address.

**4. Access MetaMask:**
   - Click on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser to access your wallet.

**5. Send Ether:**
   - To send Ether to another Ethereum address, follow these steps:
     1. In the MetaMask wallet interface, click on the "Send" or "Send Ether" button.
     2. Enter the recipient's Ethereum address.
     3. Enter the amount of Ether you want to send.
     4. Choose the network and gas fee. The gas fee is what you pay for the transaction to be processed on the Ethereum network. You can select a recommended fee or set a custom one.
     5. Confirm the transaction and enter your wallet password.
     6. Review the transaction details and confirm it once more.

**6. Transaction Confirmation:**
   - After confirming the transaction, you will receive a transaction hash. You can use this hash to track the progress of your transaction on the Ethereum blockchain by visiting an Ethereum block explorer.

**7. Transaction Costs:**
   - The cost of a transaction in Ether depends on the gas fee, which varies depending on network congestion and the complexity of the transaction. You pay this fee to miners for processing your transaction.

**8. Receipt and History:**
   - You can check your transaction history within MetaMask to see your spending and track past transactions.

**9. Security:**
   - Ensure you keep your MetaMask wallet and recovery seed phrase secure. Avoid sharing it with anyone, and be cautious when interacting with smart contracts or unknown addresses.

Remember that Ethereum gas fees can fluctuate, and it's essential to stay updated on the current fee situation to make cost-effective transactions.
